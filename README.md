A new new input system.

>NOTE: This system is still under active development and not yet stable. To run the project, you will need a [beta of Unity 2018.2](https://unity3d.com/unity/beta-download).

Some [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXbAKDQVwztY0hyyeEy9gifk-ffkgoy_Y).

>DISCLAIMER: The videos are fairly outdated by now.

More info in the [wiki](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/InputSystem/wiki) (varying degrees of up-to-dateness).

Issues are expected at this point. However, feel free to report what you find here on GitHub.
